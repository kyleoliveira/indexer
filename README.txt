Title: 
Command-line Application Code Samples - Parsing and IO

Description: 
A collection of programs that work through a command-line interface.
Sample input and output documents are provided here as well.

Indexer is a Java application that takes a plain-text file and produces
an alphabetical-ordered index of where individual words appear in the file.
It is set up as a Netbeans project, so the compiled jar file is located in the
dist folder as is the javadoc. Source files are located in the src folder.
